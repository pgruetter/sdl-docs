Smart Data Lake Builder is build to run anywhere.
As seen in [Getting Started](../getting-started/setup.md), you can easily run it in Docker with small flat files,
but you can just as well run it in a large cluster to leverage the resources of your on-premise or cloud infrastructure.

So far, we have successfully used Smart Data Lake Builder on Microsoft Azure, Google DataProc and YARN.
The following subpages help you to get started in these different environments.

- [Deploy on Microsoft Azure](deploy-microsoft-azure.md)  
- [Deploy on Google DataProc](deploy-google-dataproc.md)
- [Deploy on Yarn](deployYarn.md)
