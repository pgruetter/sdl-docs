Once you have gone through the first example, you should check out [sdl-examples](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples).  
In this separate GitHub repository, we have collected different examples highlighting the features. 

### Scaladoc
Smart Data Lake Builder comes with many types of Data Objects and Actions.
This documentation will explain many details, but it can never be as exhaustive as the [Scaladoc](http://smartdatalake.ch/docs/site/scaladocs/index.html). 
So make sure to check out the sections for 
[actions](http://smartdatalake.ch/docs/site/scaladocs/index.html#io.smartdatalake.workflow.action.package) and 
[data objects](http://smartdatalake.ch/docs/site/scaladocs/index.html#io.smartdatalake.workflow.dataobject.package). 
See if you can find the data objects and actions used in the first example and also in the sdl-examples repository.
